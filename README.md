# Typing_Speed_test
A typing speed test was used to check our keyboard typing speed. A sentence was given, and the user had to type in the specific bar and click enter to check their typing speed.
It was created because in my previous college, they conducted a tech expo for the students to show their talent. We want to make something so fun that people will love to check out our programme.Â
